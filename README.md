# REPL for use during Pathfinder 2e
Uses:
- Log how long encounters take
- Keep track of initiative
- Keep track of Character and Creature AC
- Quickly start pre-prepared combat encouters
- Track dice rolls for fun(?) statistics after a session or campaign (how many times did bless actually matter?) (todo)
